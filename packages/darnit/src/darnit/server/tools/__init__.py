"""MCP tool implementations for the darnit server.

This module provides tool implementations that can be registered with an MCP server.
Each tool is implemented as a standalone function that can be decorated with @mcp.tool().

Built-in tools (audit, remediate, list_controls) are generic implementations that
work with any TOML-defined framework. They can be referenced in TOML as:

    [mcp.tools.audit]
    builtin = "audit"
