# darnit-baseline

OpenSSF Baseline (OSPS v2025.10.10) compliance implementation for the [darnit](../darnit) framework — **62 controls** across **8 domains** and **3 maturity levels** (25 L1, 17 L2, 20 L3).

## How Controls Are Verified

Each control runs through a **sieve pipeline** — a sequence of passes that stops at the first conclusive result:

```
file_exists  →  exec / pattern  →  manual
     ↓              ↓                 ↓
File presence   Commands (gh api)   Human review
checks          & regex patterns    (fallback)
```

**Pass types:**

- **file_exists** — checks for specific files (README.md, SECURITY.md, LICENSE, etc.)
- **exec** — runs a command (typically `gh api`) and evaluates output with a CEL expression
- **pattern** — searches file contents with regex, optionally evaluates with CEL
- **manual** — fallback steps for human verification

**Conservative by default:** A control that hasn't been explicitly verified as passing reports WARN (needs verification). The system never assumes compliance.

## Control Reference

Controls gated by `platform = "github"` require the GitHub CLI (`gh`). Additional conditions are noted inline.

## Project Context

Context values serve two purposes: **(1)** they gate which controls apply to your project via `when` clauses, and **(2)** they populate templates during remediation. Controls gated by context that hasn't been set show as N/A.

Set context via the `confirm_project_context` MCP tool or by editing `.project/project.yaml`.

| Key | Type | Auto-Detect | Controls | Usage |
|-----|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| `maintainers` | list or path | Yes | GV-01.01, GV-01.02, GV-04.01 | Template variable in GOVERNANCE.md, MAINTAINERS.md, CODEOWNERS. Remediation blocks until provided. |
| `security_contact` | string | No | VM-01.01, VM-02.01, VM-03.01 | Populates SECURITY.md template |
| `governance_model` | enum | No | GV-01.01, GV-01.02 | Selects governance template variant |
| `has_subprojects` | boolean | No | QA-04.01, QA-04.02 | When-clause: controls only run if `true` |
| `has_releases` | boolean | Yes | BR-02.01, BR-04.01, BR-06.01, LE-03.02, SA-03.01 | When-clause: controls only run if `true` |
| `is_library` | boolean | No | DO-04.01, BR-01.01 | Audit hints for accuracy |
| `has_compiled_assets` | boolean | No | QA-02.02 | When-clause: control only runs if `true` |
| `ci_provider` | enum | Yes | BR-01.01, BR-01.02, AC-04.01, AC-04.02 | When-clause: controls only run if `"github"` |

## Remediation Capabilities

The implementation provides **40 automated remediation actions**: 31 file creations, 7 GitHub API calls, and 2 exec commands. All file creations are conservative-by-default (`overwrite = false`) — they never clobber existing files. All file creations support dry-run. Three governance controls (GV-01.01, GV-01.02, GV-04.01) block until project maintainers are confirmed via `confirm_project_context`. The remaining 15 controls with remediation sections provide manual guidance only, and 7 controls are verification-only with no remediation.

### File Creation (31 actions across 28 unique files)

Each action generates a file from a built-in template. Template quality ratings:

- **Production-ready** — substantive content, follows best practices, minimal customization needed
- **Good scaffold** — correct structure, needs project-specific content added
- **Starter** — minimal placeholder, must be customized before use

Five templates have `llm_enhance` prompts (marked with \*) that request LLM-based customization of the generated content.

#### Root Project Files

### API Calls (7 actions)

All target the GitHub REST API via `gh`. Require authentication with appropriate scopes (`repo`, `admin:org` for MFA).

| Control | Endpoint | What It Changes | Safe | Reversible |
|---------|----------|-----------------|:----:|:----------:|
| AC-01.01 | `PUT /orgs/$OWNER` | Enforce org-wide MFA | No | Hard — may lock out members without MFA |
| AC-02.01 | `PATCH /repos/$OWNER/$REPO` | Enable repository forking | Yes | Yes |
| AC-03.01 | `PUT .../branches/$BRANCH/protection` | Require PRs for primary branch | Yes | Yes |
| AC-03.02 | `PUT .../branches/$BRANCH/protection` | Block primary branch deletion | No | Yes |
| QA-01.01 | `PATCH /repos/$OWNER/$REPO` | Make repository public | No | Hard — may expose private code |
| QA-07.01 | `PUT .../branches/$BRANCH/protection` | Require PR approval before merge | No | Yes |
| VM-03.01 | `PUT .../private-vulnerability-reporting` | Enable private vulnerability reporting | Yes | Yes |

### Exec (2 actions)

| Control | Command | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| BR-01.01 | `zizmor --fix=all --offline` | Requires external `zizmor` tool. Applies all fixes including unsafe. GitHub Actions only |
| BR-01.02 | `zizmor --fix=all --offline` | Same command, targets branch name injection patterns |

### Manual-Only (15 controls)

These controls provide step-by-step guidance but cannot be auto-remediated.

| Control | Why Manual |
|---------|-----------|
| QA-01.02 | Commit history visibility — verification-only, nothing to change programmatically |
| QA-02.01 | Dependency manifest — project-specific; can't generate a real lockfile |
| QA-04.01 | Subproject documentation — requires human knowledge of project structure |
| QA-05.01 | No generated executables — requires human judgment on what to remove |
| QA-05.02 | No binary artifacts — requires human judgment on what to remove |
| AC-04.01 | Workflow `permissions:` declarations — requires understanding each workflow's needs |
| AC-04.02 | Least-privilege permissions — requires per-workflow security analysis |
| BR-02.01 | Unique version IDs — release versioning process is project-specific |
| BR-04.01 | Changelog in releases — changelog content is project-specific |
| BR-05.01 | Standard dependency tooling — tool adoption is a project-level decision |
| BR-02.02 | Assets linked to release IDs — release artifact process is project-specific |
| QA-03.01 | Required status checks — which checks to require depends on CI setup |
| QA-04.02 | Subproject security parity — requires cross-repo security review |
| VM-01.01 | Disclosure process in SECURITY.md — content verification is judgment-based |
| VM-04.01 | Security advisory support — GitHub platform feature, manual enablement |

### No Remediation (7 controls)

Verification-only controls that check conditions which already exist or can't be meaningfully auto-remediated: BR-03.01 (HTTPS repo URL), BR-03.02 (HTTPS distribution), GV-02.01 (Issues/Discussions enabled), LE-02.01 (OSI-approved license), LE-02.02 (License in releases), LE-03.01 (License in root), LE-03.02 (License in release archives).

### Template Quality Summary

| Rating | Count | Description |
|--------|:-----:|-------------|
| Production-ready | 15 | Substantive content following best practices — minimal customization needed |
| Good scaffold | 14 | Correct structure — needs project-specific content added |
| Starter | 2 | Minimal placeholder — must be customized before use |

**5 templates with `llm_enhance` prompts**: README.md, SECURITY.md, GOVERNANCE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, API.md — these request LLM-based customization using project context.

### Known Limitations

- Templates use `$OWNER`, `$REPO`, `$BRANCH` variables resolved from git remote — may be wrong for forks or non-standard remote names
- `security@$OWNER.github.io` in SECURITY.md is a placeholder email — almost always needs customization
- LICENSE is hardcoded to MIT — no license type selection
- GitHub Actions workflows (`ci.yml` especially) are generic starters — need language/framework adaptation
- `release-signing.yml` uses `subject-path: '.'` which should be customized to actual release artifacts
- `llm_enhance` prompts are captured in templates but the LLM integration path isn't fully wired in the remediation executor
- Three SUPPORT.md controls (DO-03.01, DO-04.01, DO-05.01) each create the same file with different templates — only the first to run takes effect due to `overwrite = false`
- API call remediations require `gh` CLI authentication with appropriate scopes (`repo`, `admin:org` for MFA enforcement)
- `zizmor --fix=all` applies all fixes including potentially unsafe ones — review changes before committing
- Manual-only controls have varying depth of guidance (some have 2 steps, some have 6)
- `dependabot.yml` only enables `github-actions` ecosystem by default — other ecosystems (npm, pip, etc.) need manual addition

## External Tool Dependencies

Some controls use external tools for deeper analysis. These are **optional** — controls gracefully fall back to built-in pattern matching when a tool is unavailable.

| Tool | Controls | Purpose | Install |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| [zizmor](https://docs.zizmor.sh/) | BR-01.01 | GitHub Actions static analysis (template injection) | `cargo install zizmor` or `brew install zizmor` |
| [gh](https://cli.github.com/) | AC-*, BR-02/03/04, LE-02/03, QA-01/03/07, GV-02, VM-03/04 | GitHub API queries | `brew install gh` |
| [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) | — | JSON processing (used internally by some exec passes) | `brew install jq` |
